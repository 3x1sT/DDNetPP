~~~ BUGS ~~~

~~~ LESS IMPORTANT BUGS ~~~

## Blockpoints ##
people can logout in freeze and kill and relog in.
so they get a nice K/D without deaths in their acc.
do something like adding blockdeath on logout in freeze or disallow it completly or stuff idk

## Jail ##
there is a crashbug with the jail command
(check crash logs)

## pChr != this ##
while working on FNN i expirienced a bug after touching the bot
and then selfkilling. The bot keeps spamming in chat "stup touch me" 
and then i added to this line:
	if (pChr && pChr->IsAlive())
this:
	if (pChr && pChr->IsAlive() && pChr != this)
what fixed it. idk if this also causes some selfblock points or something like that or if this error is catched somewhere else.
this can also fuck some dummymodes idk better check it on time

## commands ##
Almost all chat commands added require a character to be executed or it returns.
But for example /shop doesnt need it change it but be carefull it can cause crashbugs

## instagib killingspree (sv_intsa 1) ##
if you get killed by a player who left the game things get crazy even in vanilla
so stick to the blockkillingspreesystem and all is fine c:

and also if players are missing for killingsprees make it possible to end killingsprees but end how? better think of it good and maybe look ad the blockklinningspree system

## IsSameIP ##
behaves weird on local server with dummys check if it works online
and also behaved weird on official server (not local). i did '/gift Chillingo.*' and server said "don't gift ur dummy" 

~~~ ADD ~~~

## SendBroadcast int parameter ##
default 0 does what vanilla broadcast does and marks broadcast as important
para 1 only broadcasts if no recent important broadcast was send marks as important (broadcast_srv)
para 2 only broadcast if no recent important broadcast was send marks as unimportant (xp)

## livestreams ##
add '/livestream host' command to host a livestream
a hoster gets printed all '/livestream view'ers in broadcast
and the viewers get paused and focused on the tee.
there is an extra stream chat and idk totally useless feature

## drop weapons ##
on vote (f4/f3) drop the current active weapon if not gun or hammer
drop them in the map (like in survival) and all people can collect it

## sell weapons ##
'/sell grenade' to loose grenade and get some money from the server

## trade command ##
'/trade invite <item> <price> <player>'
'/trade save_accept <item> <price> <player>' #i know this command is long but it is anti scam
#'/trade accept <player>' #totally insecure but fasttyping #doesnt work with spaces in name
Items: grenade,shotgun,rifle, homing missiles ammo

## flag drops ##
the eye pos has influence on flag drop direction 

## spread gun ##
add spreading guns for supermoderators and admins to showoff only WEAPON_GUN
and maybe speedup the shootingspeed and fullauto and stuff all other weapons would be cheaty

## AddSurvival ##
add the famous survival mod into ddpp
Keep in mind that nobody should be abel to die in lobby or he wont be teleported in the arena while being dead

## king of hill ##
Capturing areas with bloody tiles which show the current leading tee

## block points dummy check ##
im very insecure baut diz. But maybe add a check where only non equal ips can collect block points

## waveblock bot sub mod ##
add something like monster where you have to hold a position
and if all humans are freezed round restarts
and add upgrades only for this sub mod like
weapons (with ammo)
jetpack
endless

## quest todo ##
inform a player of all the progress in chat if actiavted (/show /hide)

## Apocalypse ##
rework map and copy paste the whole map and then edit it to a broken version
more doodads and some gernric tiles missing and stuff like this.
then code something which changes spawns to this spawns
and init it with something crazy (for example combine all stuff 166 420 and maybe send some sounds and or a broadcast saying "rip world")
then kill all player.. and *plopp* they are in a Apocalypse version of the server o.O
the killall() maybe needs a KillDDPP() in the character.cpp DDPP_DIE() func to kill all the ddpp stuff running (minigames and stuff)

## ip und clan speichern ##
mehr daten über den user sammeln und last names mal gut testen und wenn nötig fixxen
Name Fix [x]
IP [x]
Clan [x]
Skin [x]
Country [ ]
last login date [ ]

## Homing Missiles ##
Die Waffe selber kann ab police lvl 4 erworben werden.
Monition kann jedoch jeder an den munition spawner tiles sammeln (die dort random spawnen)

## jail ##
add reasons why people get arrested (bankrob, spawnblock, report)
and add a report command
"/report (player) (reason)" to report a player
und dann ein paar reasons:
- spawnblocking
- hacking
- insulting
- scamming
und wenn dann genung reports der selben reason ankamen wird die police auf den geschickt

## police ##
add a list of gangsters their gangsta reason and escape time

## warps ##
add warps like in minecraft
/tele_create (name)
/tele (name)
works ingame
supermoderators can create some for much money but only if x < cfgrated (to avoid race cheats)
and all tele there for some money

COULD AND TO DOS:

//gamecontext.cpp code: cfv45
COULD inform creator live if some1 watched if he has this feed activated (use new show command)

//character.cpp code: 6gta8w
TODO move this check if there is an survival spawn somewhere in gamecontext to the gamestart or soemthign like that
